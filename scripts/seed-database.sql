-- Create some sample data for testing
-- This script can be run after setting up the database

-- Note: In a real application, books would be created through the UI
-- This is just for testing purposes

-- The actual user creation and book creation should be done through the application
-- since we need proper authentication and user sessions

-- Sample genres that users can choose from:
-- Fiction, Non-Fiction, Mystery, Romance, Science Fiction, Fantasy, Biography, History, Self-Help, Other

-- To test the application:
-- 1. Sign up for a new account
-- 2. Add some books using the form
-- 3. View your book collection
-- 4. Delete books as needed

-- The database schema is automatically created by Prisma when you run:
-- npx prisma db push
